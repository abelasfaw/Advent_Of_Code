# Advent of Code 2015 Solutions

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2015 programming challenges. Each puzzle is implemented as a separate script, with its own input and logic.

## Structure
- Each challenge solution is placed in its own file (e.g., `Secret_Entrance.js`).
- Input data for each challenge is typically stored in a corresponding `input.txt` file.
- This repository will grow as more daily challenges are solved and added.

## How to Use
1. Find the script for the day/challenge you want to run (e.g., `Secret_Entrance.js`).
2. Ensure the required input file (e.g., `input.txt`) is present in the same directory.
3. Run the script using Node.js:
   ```sh
   node <script_name.js>
   ```
   Replace `<script_name.js>` with the actual file name.
4. The script will output the solution for that day's challenge.

## Conventions
- Each solution is self-contained and may have its own input parsing logic.
- Scripts are named to reflect the challenge or puzzle they solve.
- Inputs and outputs are not standardized across all days; check each script for specifics.

## Example
- `Secret_Entrance.js` solves one of the 2015 challenges using instructions from `input.txt`.
